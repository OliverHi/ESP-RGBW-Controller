# Analog-RGBW-Controller
This is my rgbw controller project, where I am building a mysensors node to controll an analog RGBW led strip. 
The hardware is build around the arduino pro mini and NRF24L01+. 
The software is build on the MySensors project and is currently designed to work with Domoticz, Openhab 2 and homeAssistant (experimental) as a controller.
