# Analog-RGBW-Controller
This is my rgbw controller project, where I am building a mysensors node to controll an analog RGBW led strip. 
The hardware is build around the arduino pro mini and NRF24L01+. 
The software is build on the MySensors project and is currently designed to work with Domoticz, Openhab 2 and homeAssistant (experimental) as a controller.

## Project frozen/final
This project is done from my side. It has been working for years but I switched to another solution so I won't update this anymore. Feel free to send me Pull Requests though if you want anything updated or fork this repo.
