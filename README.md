# Analog-RGBW-Controller
This is my rgbw controller project, where I am building a mysensors node to controll an analog RGBW led strip. The hardware is build around the arduino pro mini (I will upload the sketches soon). The software is build on the MySensors project and is currently design to work with Domoticz as a controller.
